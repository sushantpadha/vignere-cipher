```


## Usage

Follow the steps outlined in the [Installation](#installation) section.

Use the script with the command

```bash
python -m vignere_cipher [options]
```

### Command line usage

```text
usage: vignere_cipher [-h] -k KEY [-e | -d] text

encrypt and decipher messages with vignere cipher

positional arguments:
  text        text message to decrypt or encrypt (all non-alphabetic characters will be removed)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -k KEY      key to use to en/decrypt text (all non-alphabetic characters will be removed)

“Sometimes it’s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.” (Imitation Game, 2014)
```

### Examples

1. To encrypt the text `attackatdawn` with the key `lemon`, use the following command

  ```bash
  python -m vignere_cipher "attackatdawn" -k "lemon" -e
  ```

2. To decrypt the text `lxfopvefrnhr` with the key `lemon`, use the following command

  ```bash
  python -m vignere_cipher "lxfopvefrnhr" -k "lemon" -d
  ```

## Developing

1. Download the source code.
2. Open up a terminal.
3. `cd` into the project root†.
4. Run the command (mind the period at the end of the command)
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -e .
   ```

To develop you will need to install [Python3](https://python.org) for your specific OS and architecture

Other than that, you will also need some dependencies.

They can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file provided in the source.

Just run

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests, simply `cd` into the source root†† and execute the following command

```bash
python -m pytest .
```
